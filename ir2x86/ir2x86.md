# ir2x86

The ir2x86 package translates ir into x86 executable code. It does not embed it in a binary, see `ir2triple::linux_elf` for that. While the majority of the code generated by ir2x86 does not conform to any specification and cannot be relied upon between versions, the following assertions are made in order to allow some form of FFI:

1. `ValueType::Ref(T)` is represented in C as `T*`
2. `StorableType::Slice(T)` is represented in C as
```
struct {
	T* elements;
	size_t length;
};
```
3. SYSV ABI calling conventions are used
